# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Administering and managing software development at scale, in an enterprise environment, can present a few challenges. In this technical demonstration, we will walk through the benefits of establishing a DevOps platform utilizing GitLab and OCI to enable collaboration across teams and deliver secure applications faster. Combining GitLab’s continuous integration and deployment (CI) pipeline to deploy containerized applications with Oracle Kubernetes Engine enables your organization to define appropriate development processes, automate security scans and compliance checks and leverage OCI to run applications faster and more securely.

Estimated Workshop Time: 3 hours 30 minutes (This estimate is for the entire workshop - it is the sum of the estimates provided for each of the labs included in the workshop.)
